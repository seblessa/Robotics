# Introduction to Intelligent Robotics Class

This is a forked repository from the original [Intelligent Robotics Class](https://github.com/GoncaloLeao/IRI_public_TP_classes).
Our professor prepared a simulation with a set of exercises to be done in a [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) environment.
